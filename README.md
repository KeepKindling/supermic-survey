# Bugs/Issues encountered
- Whilst trying to validate the name variable inside of the get_info method, kept getting the error message "name is not defined". I think it's related to the scope of where I'm defining name. Tried using the global attribute in front of the name variable but did not fix it, currently stuck. ! Fixed the issue by using the global attribute correctly. I placed it in front of the name variable but i needed to give the variable global scope before defining it. not at the same time.
- Attempting to validate the value of name to check it is only using alphabetical letters. if name != str():. This did not work so tried to use isalpha() but prints error message regardless of which characters are used when inputting name value. Also tried using a for loop that would iterate through each character of the value of name and use isalpha() to check for letters but did not work either. ! Fixed by removing the try statement and using a while True statement to check the entire value at once inside of name. Credit to sean at code institute tutor session for help with this solve.
- caused issue where the code would not print ValueError message within validate_name method. I decided to add the question for name into validate_name method and use while True, try: statement. ValueError wasnt showing up when i tested with an incorrect value so I tried removing it entirely which cause an infinite loop to occur. So decided to leave ValueError in the except argument and an if statement and just print a string to the user telling them their value was invalid. CURRENTLY UNFIXED
